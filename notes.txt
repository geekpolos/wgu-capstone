##NPM
Start application by running "npm init"

##################
##Git

Initialize Project 
To start off the project, use "git init" to initalize Git in the project. 

Ignore Files
Use .gitignore to ignore files and folders that Git should not track. A common use is to ignore the folder node_modules/.

Setup Remote Repo
After a repo is created on GitHub.com, I can push an existing reporistory by running the command "git remote add origin https://github.com/geekpolos/wgu-capstone.git"

Push Initial Code
Then, run "git push -u origin master" to push the initial code to GitHub.

##################
##Heroku

Add Keys to herkou
Enter the comman "heroku keys:add" to add local keys to heroku to create a secure connection

Create Heroku Server
You can create a server on Heroku by typing in the following: "heroku create server-name". The server-name is a placeholder for what you want the server name to be.

###How to push local environment to GitHub and Heroku.

1) git status
This step isn't necessary, but it helps me know what files are ready to be added. 

2) git add .
Then, I can add all files using the dot operator or I can choose individual files. 

3) git commit -m "update message goes here"
After the files are added, I commit my changes using git commit follow by the message of my commit. 

3) git push
Once I've added the files, I push the changes to my GitHub repo. 

4) git push heroku master
Finally, I push my changes to heroku. 

These steps are made available because I've setup SSH keys with GitHub and Heroku. 

##################
###Running files locally

npm run start
This command kicks off Node locally so I can test locally. The port for the web-server is on 3000 so I would use localhost:3000

nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs
Or, I can use nodemon to relaunch the application everytime I make a change. The arguments js,hbs stand for javascript,handbrake which indiciates to restart any javascript or handbrake files. 
Update: I added a shortcut to package.json so I can use "npm run dev" as a shortcut.
